Please follow these instructions when submitting your BG Script:

0. Make sure the script is in either a standalone text file (including text hosted on a site such as [hastebin](https://hastebin.com/)), or in the `#BGCHANGES`/`#FGCHANGES` section(s) of an otherwise-unedited `.sm` or `.ssc` file, and that it is able to be accessed through a link.
1. Describe the script info in the format of:
  * [Song Title]
  * [Song Group/Folder/Category]
  * [Video/BGAnimation Set(s), i.e. Beware's, ULTRAMIX 2, etc]
  * [Any necessary notes]
2. Post the link to the script, following the guidelines of Step 0.
