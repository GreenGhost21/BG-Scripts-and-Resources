# BG Scripts

Scripts assume that the video sets are in their own respective folders inside the RandomMovies folder. 

BGScript folder hierarchy goes in order of:
1. Simfile Category (`Arcade` or `Microsoft Xbox`, as examples)
2. Simfile Source (The dropdown on ZIv that takes you to the game's simfile group. Could also be a folder of user-made simfiles)
3. Simfile Name
4. `.sm`, `.ssc`, or text file with `#BGCHANGES`/`#FGCHANGES` only, titled as `[Script Source] ([Video Set]) {[Script Author]}.

My `ULTRAMIX 3` Script for `Butterfly` would, for example, be in:

```
Arcade/Dance Dance Revolution (AC) (Japan)/Butterfly/ULTRAMIX3 (ULTRAMIX3) {GreenGhost21}.txt
```

Another example from the first post on the [BG Scripts thread](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/thread?threadid=4519) would be:

```
Arcade/DanceDanceRevolution SuperNOVA (AC) (International)/LOGICAL DASH/DDRMAX2 JP CS (MAX-EXTREME) {DarkFeline}
```

This hierarchy ought to be sufficiently clear and distinct for most cases.

Suggestions for alternative hierarchy orders are still appreciated!
