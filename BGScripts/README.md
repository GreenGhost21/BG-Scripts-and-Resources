# BG Scripts
Folder hierarchy goes in order of:
1. BG Script author's name
2. Simfile source (`Zenius-I-vanisher`, for example)
3. Video set (e.g.: `Beware's`; `ULTRAMIX 2`; etc.)
4. Simfile Group (The folder that the song belongs in; for ZIv, it'd be the Simfile Category)
5. Simfile Name
6. `.sm`, `.ssc`, or text file with `#BGCHANGES`/`#FGCHANGES`.

My ULTRAMIX 3 Script for `Butterfly` would, for example, be in:

```
GreenGhost21/Zenius-I-vanisher/ULTRAMIX3/Dance Dance Revolution (AC) (Japan)/Butterfly/butterfly.txt
```

Different scripts for the same song, even from the same author, are allowed.
