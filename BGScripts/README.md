# BG Scripts
Folder hierarchy goes in order of:
1. Video set (e.g.: `Beware's`; `ULTRAMIX 2`; etc.)
2. Simfile source (`Zenius-I-vanisher`, for example)
3. Simfile Group (The folder that the song belongs in; for ZIv, it'd be the Simfile Category)
4. Simfile Name
5. `.sm`, `.ssc`, or text file with `#BGCHANGES`/`#FGCHANGES` only, titled by author.

My `ULTRAMIX 3` Script for `Butterfly` would, for example, be in:

```
ULTRAMIX3/Zenius-I-vanisher/Dance Dance Revolution (AC) (Japan)/Butterfly/GreenGhost21.txt
```

Different scripts for the same song, even from the same author, are allowed.

Suggestions for alternative hierarchy orders are appreciated!
